This repository is used to store files and code used in our analyses

Folders with data:
- 'density-estimates' is used to store species density estimates per habitat (taken from 2018 mammal review)
- 'species-ranges' is used to store species range maps (taken from 2018 mammal review)
- 'planting-simulation' contains results from our simulated afforestation scenarios - the area of each suitable habitat within species ranges
