# Afforestation-writing-retreat - Jan 2022
This repository is used to store files and code used in our analyses

Folders with data:
- 'density-estimates' is used to store species density estimates per habitat (taken from 2018 mammal review)
- 'species-ranges' is used to store species range maps (taken from 2018 mammal review)
- 'planting-simulation' contains results from our simulated afforestation scenarios - the area of each suitable habitat within species ranges

Code:
- Pop_estimates.R is used to calculate the estimated population densities from the simulated planting scenarios
- WoodlandOppchangeEngland.Rmd is used to simulate planting scenarios in each species range
